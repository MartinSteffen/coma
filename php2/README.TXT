This is the README.TXT of the CoMa conference manager software. This software was written during a practice at the University of Kiel, Chair of software technology (http://www.uni-kiel.de/inf/deRoever/) by the members of the group of students named group "PHP2". The goal of this practice was to train programming-in-the-many, means developing a huge project, delegating its parts to smaller Teams working together.

CoMa is a software usable for the management of conferences in university environment. It allows to create, administer and publish conferences, to invite authors, reviewers and visitors, to manage a Call for Papers, to supervize reviewing of those Papers and
 it supports paper discussion and helps deciding which papers should be used for the conference program.

The main concept of CoMa is to associate registered users with the role they fulfill in a conference, and to generate a list of their tasks / actions they must / can do for this conference. There are 5 Roles a conference participant can get:

-Admin, technical supervisor of the installation, allowed to create new conferences and Chair accounts.
-Conference Chair, allowed to manage conference participants, details and program
-Author, allowed to participate in the Call for Papers. His Paper will be reviewed, discussed and accepted or declined for conference program by Conference Chair.
-Reviewer, allowed (and wanted) to review Author's papers, rate it and (in case of conflicts at rating) discuss it with other reviewers.
-Participant, allowed to see some details of interest about conference's program as released by Chair.

Using a web-based approach, CoMa is accessible for everybody with internet connection and a browser, so there is no need for email/phone correspondency. Further, all data regarding a conference is stored within the system, and will be kept until a conference is over (and even longer, until the admin clears the data). This allows participants to concentrate on conference/paper discussion.

To Install the software please see INSTALL.TXT in this directory.

As this software is free (and might never be properly released), you use it at your own risk. We don't guarantee for anything, and we are not the ones to blame if something does not work the way expected.

We hope you enjoy using CoMa as much as we enjoyed creating.

best regards

the PHP2-members of the CoMa project
