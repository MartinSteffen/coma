We have chosen an (almost standard-conform) UML-class diagram notation.  (cf.
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram}).


\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[height=12cm]{../sql/db_schema}
  \caption{Class diagram}
  \label{fig:classdiagram}
\end{figure}

The diagram was worked out after discussion on the bulletin board in the
plenum. It took inspiration from the two specification deliverables
\cite{coma:spec1} \cite{coma:spec2}, at least the static part, for instance
the ER-diagram from \cite{coma:spec1}, but also from different variations
from the data model of this document, version 2.

The graphical representation from Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram} is
simplified insofar as plain fields are left out. Those are specified in
more detail





\subsection*{SQL-model}
\label{sec:datamodel.sql}
%

The following is as ``textual'' representation of the data model, as worked
out by S. Esquivel, M.\ Albari, G. Biederbeck, and others.

I leave out in the discussion of the ``central'' classes as they seems
obvious, but concentrate more on the tables reprasenting classes.



\subsubsection*{Role and Roles}
\label{sec:roleandroles}%

Deviating from the picture on the blackboard (and from
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram}), there are \emph{two} tables: \texttt{Role}
and \texttt{Roles}. This is introduces to model the fact that \emph{the
  same person} can be present in \emph{two} conferences at the same time in
two different ways\footnote{Remember: that was not on the plate in the
  original Version 2 of the doc. In the older model, a person was
  associated with exactly one conference.}

We start deconstructing the diagram according to the classes, obvious
fields we omit in the discussion here (they might get filled in later). We
start with the main ``entities'', and discuss the ``associations'' later.

\subsection*{SQL-Spec}
\label{sec:sql}
\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=5,language=sql}

Relevant is only the SQL-Spec.

\lstinputlisting[caption=DB: conference,label=code:sql.conference,firstline=27,lastline=44]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%


The table conferences (cf.\ Listing~\ref{code:sql.conference}) contains all
the conferences being hosted by the server. We propose that there exists as
\emph{default, empty conference} to begin with as entry in the table. This
default conference is charakterized by the empty string. Most of the
entries in the table should be self-explanatory. For the deadlines, the
following ones are foreseen, in the order of events:
\index{deadlines}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{abstract submission deadline.} This typically is a
  (secondary) deadline for \emph{authors} shortly before the paper
  submission deadline.  It allows the authors to upload an abstract of
  their papers. There is not much ``semantics'' behind this deadline, only
  that experience shows that it helps in organizing the conference to know
  in advances how many papers there will be, about what topics etc. A
  further advantage of the abstract submission deadline is that it may
  ``encourage'' the authors to try to meet the real paper deadline a little
\item The \emph{paper submission deadline.} This is the most important
  deadline for authors, namely: when must they finished their work! After
  that deadline, no new papers or new versions of the paper may be
  uploaded.\footnote{A exception may be, that the chair make a personal
    exception or something, but that's only by circumventing the normal
    process.}
\item The \emph{review deadline:} That's the first deadline for the
  \emph{reviewers,} namely: when must they have finished their reading job
  and must have handed in the grades; on the basis of this information, the
  discussion and selection starts.
\item The \emph{notification deadline:} this is the deadline when the
  \emph{selection} has ended and when the authors are notified about their
  success or failure.
\item The \emph{final version} deadline: afterwards, the successful authors
  may be required to up-load the ``very final version'' to be printed,
  sometimes also called \emph{camera ready version}, which takes into
  account the criticism of the reviewers.
\end{enumerate}


\medskip{}



The \emph{persons} using the tool are all kept in the table
\texttt{Person}. Again most fields should be self-explanatory. Not all
fields of a person must be filled in; in order to facilitate communication,
we require the \emph{email address}; for secure identification furthermore
a password (cf.\ Listing~\ref{code:sql.person}).  An

\lstinputlisting[caption=Person,label=code:sql.person,firstline=45,lastline=60]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%

\medskip{}

\index{role}
Crucial for the interaction of persons with he tool are the \emph{roles}
the persons play (cf~\ref{code:sql.role}. Some of them were mentioned
informally in the requirements specification \cite{coma:requirements}. In
the course of the semester, we reached at \emph{no agreement} how to
represent the role. Thus, neither the representation no the exact choice of
roles are indicated in the shown SQL-code.

\lstinputlisting[caption=Role,label=code:sql.role,firstline=65,lastline=79]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%


In the textual representation which is agreed upon as supplementary global
spec, we fixed the roles of Table~\ref{tab:roles} to be mandatory. The
numbers indicate the numerical representation, if no enumeration and
additional table \texttt{Roles} is chosen.  \index{roles}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \\
    role & integer
    \\\hline
    without role & 00 
    \\
    admin & 01
    \\
    chair & 02
    \\
    reviewer & 03
    \\
    author & 04
    \\
    participant & 05
    \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{roles}
  \label{tab:roles}
\end{table}


\medskip%

\emph{Papers} are the things that the authors produce and upload via the
tool in the process called \emph{submission.} In general, it's some form of
document, typcally in postscript or as pdf format; each document must have
an \emph{author} and belongs to one particular conference. The person
indicated here as author is also called the \emph{corresponding author}
which refers to the one from the authors who takes main resposability to
interact with the system.
\index{author!corresponding}%
The \emph{abstract} of a paper is a short text which summarizes in a few
lines the content of the paper.

\lstinputlisting[caption=Paper,label=code:sql.paper,firstline=80,lastline=100]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%

The \emph{state} of a paper is used in the reviewing phase to indicate
certain high-level information concerning the result of the discussion.
\index{paper!state} The states agreed upon are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:paper.state}. The numerical representation is included for
those implementations, that do not want to use an extra table.



\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    state & num. representation
    \\\hline
    no special state (not being reviewed) & 00
    \\
    being reviewed
    & 
    01
    \\
    being reviewed, conflicting
    &
    02
    \\
    accepted
    &
    03
    \\
    rejected
    &
    04
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{State}
  \label{tab:paper.state}
\end{table}


Each paper has at least one author, as a paper does not write itself. A
paper may have more than one author, though, and the additional ones are
called in the context of \Coma\ coauthors.\footnote{In real life, of course,
  all are authors, but on the model, one particular author is singled out,
  and the others, if any, are called coauthors of the paper.}
