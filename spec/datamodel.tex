We have chosen an (almost standard-conform) UML-class diagram notation.  (cf.
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram}).


\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[height=12cm]{../sql/db_schema}
  \caption{Class diagram}
  \label{fig:classdiagram}
\end{figure}

The diagram was worked out after discussion on the bulletin board in the
plenum. It took inspiration from the two specification deliverables
\cite{coma:spec1} \cite{coma:spec2}, at least the static part, for instance
the ER-diagram from \cite{coma:spec1}, but also from different variations
from the data model of this document, version 2.

The graphical representation from Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram} is
simplified insofar as plain fields are left out. Those are specified in
more detail





\subsection*{SQL-model}
\label{sec:datamodel.sql}
%

The following is as ``textual'' representation of the data model, as worked
out by S. Esquivel, M.\ Albari, G. Biederbeck, and others.

I leave out in the discussion of the ``central'' classes as they seems
obvious, but concentrate more on the tables reprasenting classes.



\subsubsection*{Role and Roles}
\label{sec:roleandroles}%

Deviating from the picture on the blackboard (and from
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram}), there are \emph{two} tables: \texttt{Role}
and \texttt{Roles}. This is introduces to model the fact that \emph{the
  same person} can be present in \emph{two} conferences at the same time in
two different ways\footnote{Remember: that was not on the plate in the
  original Version 2 of the doc. In the older model, a person was
  associated with exactly one conference.}


\subsubsection{Preferred topics}
\label{sec:preferredtopic}

\end{figure}

We start deconstructing the diagram according to the classes, obvious
fields we omit in the discussion here (they might get filled in later). We
start with the main ``entities'', and discuss the ``associations'' later.
