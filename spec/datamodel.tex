We have chosen an (almost standard-conform) UML-class diagram notation.  (cf.
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram}).


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=12cm]{../sql/db_schema}
  \caption{Class diagram}
  \label{fig:classdiagram}
\end{figure}

The diagram was worked out after discussion on the bulletin board in the
plenum. It took inspiration from the two specification deliverables
\cite{coma:spec1} \cite{coma:spec2}, at least the static part, for instance
the ER-diagram from \cite{coma:spec1}, but also from different variations
from the data model of this document, version 2.

The graphical representation from Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram} is
simplified insofar as plain fields are left out. Those are specified in
more detail





\subsection*{SQL-model}
\label{sec:datamodel.sql}
%

The following is as ``textual'' representation of the data model, as worked
out by S. Esquivel, M.\ Albari, G. Biederbeck, and others.


\lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\scriptsize]{../sql/db_schema.txt}


\iffalse
I leave out in the discussion of the ``central'' classes as they seems
obvious, but concentrate more on the tables reprasenting classes.



\subsubsection*{Role and Roles}
\label{sec:roleandroles}%

Deviating from the picture on the blackboard (and from
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram}), there are \emph{two} tables: \texttt{Role}
and \texttt{Roles}. This is introduces to model the fact that \emph{the
  same person} can be present in \emph{two} conferences at the same time in
two different ways\footnote{Remember: that was not on the plate in the
  original Version 2 of the doc. In the older model, a person was
  associated with exactly one conference.}

We start deconstructing the diagram according to the classes, obvious
fields we omit in the discussion here (they might get filled in later). We
start with the main ``entities'', and discuss the ``associations'' later.

\subsection*{SQL-Spec}
\label{sec:sql}
\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,stepnumber=5,language=sql,frame=tb}

Relevant is only the SQL-Spec.



The table conferences (cf.\ Listing~\ref{code:sql.conference}) contains all
the conferences being hosted by the server. We propose that there exists as
\emph{default, empty conference} to begin with as entry in the table. This
default conference is characterized by the empty string. 


\lstinputlisting[caption=DB: conference,label=code:sql.conference,firstline=27,lastline=44]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%

Most of the entries in the table should be self-explanatory.  For the
deadlines, the following ones are foreseen, in the order of events:
\index{deadlines}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{abstract submission deadline.} This typically is a
  (secondary) deadline for \emph{authors} shortly before the paper
  submission deadline.  It allows the authors to upload an abstract of
  their papers. There is not much ``semantics'' behind this deadline, only
  that experience shows that it helps in organizing the conference to know
  in advances how many papers there will be, about what topics etc. A
  further advantage of the abstract submission deadline is that it may
  ``encourage'' the authors to try to meet the real paper deadline a little
\item The \emph{paper submission deadline.} This is the most important
  deadline for authors, namely: when must they finished their work! After
  that deadline, no new papers or new versions of the paper may be
  uploaded.\footnote{A exception may be, that the chair make a personal
    exception or something, but that's only by circumventing the normal
    process.}
\item The \emph{review deadline:} That's the first deadline for the
  \emph{reviewers,} namely: when must they have finished their reading job
  and must have handed in the grades; on the basis of this information, the
  discussion and selection starts.
\item The \emph{notification deadline:} this is the deadline when the
  \emph{selection} has ended and when the authors are notified about their
  success or failure.
\item The \emph{final version} deadline: afterwards, the successful authors
  may be required to up-load the ``very final version'' to be printed,
  sometimes also called \emph{camera ready version}, which takes into
  account the criticism of the reviewers.
\end{enumerate}


\medskip{}



The \emph{persons} using the tool are all kept in the table
\texttt{Person}. Again most fields should be self-explanatory. Not all
fields of a person must be filled in; in order to facilitate communication,
we require the \emph{email address}; for secure identification furthermore
a password (cf.\ Listing~\ref{code:sql.person}).  An

\lstinputlisting[caption=Person,label=code:sql.person,firstline=45,lastline=60]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%

\medskip{}

\index{role}
Crucial for the interaction of persons with he tool are the \emph{roles}
the persons play (cf~\ref{code:sql.role}. Some of them were mentioned
informally in the requirements specification \cite{coma:requirements}. In
the course of the semester, we reached at \emph{no agreement} how to
represent the role. Thus, neither the representation no the exact choice of
roles are indicated in the shown SQL-code.

\lstinputlisting[caption=Role,label=code:sql.role,firstline=65,lastline=79]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%


In the textual representation which is agreed upon as supplementary global
spec, we fixed the roles of Table~\ref{tab:roles} to be mandatory. The
numbers indicate the numerical representation, if no enumeration and
additional table \texttt{Roles} is chosen.  \index{roles}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \\
    role & integer
    \\\hline
    without role & 00 
    \\
    admin & 01
    \\
    chair & 02
    \\
    reviewer & 03
    \\
    author & 04
    \\
    participant & 05
    \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{roles}
  \label{tab:roles}
\end{table}


\medskip%

\emph{Papers} are the things that the authors produce and upload via the
tool in the process called \emph{submission.} In general, it's some form of
document, typcally in postscript or as pdf format; each document must have
an \emph{author} and belongs to one particular conference. The person
indicated here as author is also called the \emph{corresponding author}
which refers to the one from the authors who takes main resposability to
interact with the system.
\index{author!corresponding}%
The \emph{abstract} of a paper is a short text which summarizes in a few
lines the content of the paper.

\lstinputlisting[caption=Paper,label=code:sql.paper,firstline=80,lastline=100]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%

The \emph{state} of a paper is used in the reviewing phase to indicate
certain high-level information concerning the result of the discussion.
\index{paper!state} The states agreed upon are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:paper.state}. The numerical representation is included for
those implementations, that do not want to use an extra table.



\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    state & num. representation
    \\\hline
    no special state (not being reviewed) & 00
    \\
    being reviewed
    & 
    01
    \\
    being reviewed, conflicting
    &
    02
    \\
    accepted
    &
    03
    \\
    rejected
    &
    04
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{State}
  \label{tab:paper.state}
\end{table}


Each paper has at least one author, as a paper does not write itself. A paper
may have more than one author, though, and the additional ones are called in
the context of \Coma\ coauthors.\footnote{In real life, of course, all are
  authors, but on the model, one particular author is singled out, and the
  others, if any, are called coauthors of the paper.} 
\index{coauthor}%
The table \texttt{IsCoauthorOf} associates persons and papers (cf.\ 
Listing~\ref{code:sql.iscoauthorof}). The name-field is to contain the name of
the coauthor as string.  As the coauthor does not have a active role in
connection with the tool, it may suffices to keep the name of the coauthor;
this avoids a full ``registration'' of the coauthor in the tool.
Alternatively, the coauthor can be represented as an entry in the table of
persons. As a constraint, exactly one of the field \texttt{person\_id} or the
name field may be non-trivially filled in.

\index{coauthor!name}%

\lstinputlisting[caption=Coauthor,label=code:sql.iscoauthorof,firstline=100,lastline=109]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%

\index{topic}%
As the name indicates, a \emph{topic} is some area of research of interest for
a particular conference, and especially of interest for some of the reviewers
of the conference, and it may be a topic dealt with in the papers (cf.\ 
Listing~\ref{code:sql.topic}). In general, each conference has a certain
number of topics, which are selected when planning the conference.  Also the
number of topics cannot be predefined, some conferences like to concentrate on
4 chosen topics, others which to cover 20 or more. So a topic is associated
with a conference, and field carrying the semantic information is the
\texttt{name}-field, which contains a (usually not too long) descriptive
string. 

\lstinputlisting[caption=Scientific topics,label=code:sql.topic,firstline=110,lastline=119]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%


The topic can be used by authors, which categorize their paper into a number
of topics given for the conference and which they feel appropriate when
submitting.  Furthermore, the algorithm which assigns reviewers to papers may
make use of this table (cf.\ \cite{coma:requirements}). The corresponding
associations between papers and topics respectively between topics and
reviewers are shown in Listing~\ref{code:sql.isabouttopic} and
\ref{code:sql.preferstopic}
\index{topic!of a paper}%
\index{topic!preferred topic of a reviewer}%





\lstinputlisting[caption=Topic of a paper,label=code:sql.isabouttopic,firstline=120,lastline=132]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%

\lstinputlisting[caption=Preferred topic,label=code:sql.preferstopic,firstline=133,lastline=145]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%




\medskip

Listing~\ref{code:sql.prefersdeniesexcludespaper} shows three further
associations of persons, in particular reviewers) with papers. The first one
expresses a preference of a reviewer for a paper with the same intention as
the preference of a reviewer for a topic, namely for use in the distribution
of papers to reviewers.
\index{paper!preferred paper of a reviewer}%
The remaining to tables express situation where it is not possible for a
reviewer to review a paper. The first one is the situation where the reviewer
simply \emph{refuses} to review the paper for some reason, i.e., his
unwillingness to do work on that particular paper is so extreme, that the
distribution algorithm guarantees that the reviewer is not assigned this
paper.\footnote{A typical reason for ``unwillingness'' is that the reviewer is
  a friend or collegue of the author and thinks he cannot judge the paper
  without bias.} The association \texttt{ExcludesPaper} is even more severe.
Is may be the case that a single person acts in the role of a reviewer and in
the role of an author (or coauthor) in the same conference. In this case he
\emph{must} not review is paper or take part in the discussion, and even more:
he is not even allowed to follow passively the disucssion about his paper
(cf.\ \cite{coma:requirements}).

\lstinputlisting[caption=Reviewer-paper
associations,label=code:sql.prefersdeniesexcludespaper,firstline=146,lastline=185]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%



\index{review report} 

A review report is produced by a rewiewer reflecting his opinion about one
paper. The review is partly free-form text, where the reviewer expression
freely his opinion and gives hints about possible errors or whatever he feels
appropriate to remark, but also contains standardized parts such as
categorized (numerical) grades. The free-form text is stored in the summary-,
the remarks-, and the confidential-field. The confidential text is the part of
the review that the author must not see in the end, whereas all other parts of
the review except the identity of the reviewer itself, will be passed to the
author. 

\index{review report!confidential part}

\lstinputlisting[caption=Report,label=code:sql.reviewreport,firstline=186,lastline=201]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%



The structures for grading of a submission, i.e., the not-so-free-form of
the review report, is shown in Listing~\ref{code:sql.criterionandrating}.
In a simular way that the organizes of a conference can choose a number of
topics that they wish to be treated in the conference, they can choose a
rating schema to assure that the ``best'' papers are selected.
\index{rating}%
This involves a number of categories, the \emph{criteria,} according to
which the papers are to be judged. Typical examples are \emph{technical
  soundness,} \emph{relevance to the conference,} \emph{originality/novelty
  of contribution,} \emph{writing style} etc. The table \texttt{Criterion}
represents the possible criteria chosen for a conference, where the field
\texttt{name} represents the human understandable string characterizing the
criterion, and \texttt{description} is used for some more explanatory text
about the criterion (for instance, whether a small value is better than a
high value or other information which helps the reviewer). The criteria are
all represented by numerical values, and \texttt{max\_value} gives the
maximal possible value. The \texttt{quality\_rating} \ldots

The rating of a paper (cf. table \texttt{Rating}) then contains the actual
grading for a given paper, i.e., the numerical values per criterion for the
paper according to the review report at hand (the field \texttt{grade}).
Apart from the numerical value, the reviewer can add some explanatory text
or justification for this grade in the field \texttt{comment}.


\lstinputlisting[caption=Rating of papers,label=code:sql.criterionandrating,firstline=204,lastline=230]{../sql/db_schema.sql}%


\medskip

The last two tables are concerned with the \emph{discussion forum} of a
conference. The main purpose is to facilitate the exchange of opinions and
coming to a consensus among reviewers during the reviewing and selection
phase (cf.\ Listing~\ref{code:sql.forumandmessage}).
