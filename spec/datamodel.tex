We have chosen an (almost standard-conform) UML-class diagram notation.  (cf.
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram}).

\end{figure}

For the diagram, we took inspiration from the two specification deliverables
\cite{coma:spec1} \cite{coma:spec2}, at least the static part, for instance
the ER-diagram from \cite{coma:spec1} In most cases we simplified the set-up
(and left-out ertain parts).








\subsection*{SQL-model}

The following is as ``textual'' representation of the data model, as worked
out by S. Esquivel, M.\ Albari, G. Biederbeck, and \ldots

\subsection*{Open points}

I list current open question, that I've seen on the bulletin board.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{Conference.desciption}: it's in the textual code, but not in
    the SQL-code. Recommendation: remove in the SQL thing
  \item \textbf{Person.conference:} varchar \texttt{29} to \texttt{20:}
    \texttt{20} is ok, do this in \texttt{SQL}
  \item \textbf{roles:} Int or Bit Vector: not so crucial, but agree
  \item \textbf{paper.id} Bigint: in the textual form: it's int now, in SQL it's
    bigint. agree
  \item \textbf{CoAuthorOf:} field email not necessary (or at least is allowed
    to be zero): Currently it's non-null. Name would suffice. In the UML
    diagram, a set of strings was proposed
  \item \textbf{Forgotten: a reviewer reject to review a paper:} add an assoc
    \texttt{WantsNotReview}
  \item \textbf{must\_not\_review}: This was an association, which was proposed
    in the UML diagram, associating \texttt{Person} and \texttt{Paper}
  \item \textbf{where are grades?:} 
  \item \textbf{Value names}:
  \item \textbf{Forum title:}
  \item \textbf{Forum description:}
  \item \textbf{How to assoc. a forum to a paper?}
  \item \textbf{ParticipatesInForum} to \texttt{ParticipantsInForum}: not yet
    done in SQL
  \end{enumerate}
\item 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{HasThread:} that has been removed
  \item \textbf{User:} only per conference? In other words, if a user wants to
  participate in various conferences, he has to login separately? Answer is:
  yes, that's intended. And I agree with Sandro
\item \textbf{In Person:} reference to rights,id. I could not find that
\item \texttt{redundant references:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  from \texttt{Person} to  \texttt{Conference} 
  \item from \texttt{User} to \texttt{Rights}
  \item from \texttt{Rights} to \texttt{Roles}
  \item from \texttt{Roles} to \texttt{Conference}
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{redundant reference:} 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  in \texttt{isCoAuthor} to \texttt{Paper}
    and to \texttt{Conference}. In principle, I agree. Depends however, how
    complex the coauthor is modelled.
  \item \texttt{IsAboutTopic} connects \texttt{Paper} and \texttt{Conference}
    via \texttt{Topic}, but there's also a direct connection from \texttt{Paper}
    to \texttt{Conference}
  \item \texttt{ReviewReport} to \texttt{Conference}
  \end{itemize}
\item Remark: I agree with the comment of Sandro: Paper and Topic should be
  connected to the conference.
\end{enumerate}
\item Further stuff:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Mohamed is the only one to adapt SQL
  \item Sandro defends his proposition concerning roles., ivanilas  has a more
  complex proposal
\item Discussion about \textbf{IDs}. The arguments on the table are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{efficiency/perfomance:} I think it's not so important.
  \item \emph{changeability:} what if a user changes his email. I think that's
    a valid valid
  \item \emph{uniqueness:} what if there are different writings of an email
  \item \textrm{readability/understandability:} I'd say: not so relevant
  \item a real problem is indeed: one user in different conferences, but one
    can solve it via \textbf{Ids} or without
  \item adaptability: do we want to find later new roles? My remark: now, we
    have problems enough. I agree with Marcel, we should not design for
    adaptability in this respect and in this way. Besides that, using integers
    because there's `` still so much space left in \texttt{Int}, which we can
    later use, perhaps, if we have something forgotten'', it sounds not
    convincing, it sounds not even like \emph{adaptability,} more like leaving
    the door open for a future hack, if we need one :-) There's still the
    disagreement about the extra table for the roles. We must take a decision.
  \end{itemize}
\item\textbf{Exclude paper:} missing
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Request of ``Stop the discussion'':} (by Tom) 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The discussion can indeed can grow into a problem. As yesterday
    already indicated in the general email: Indeed: underlying may be
    (amongst others) a communication problem. One of the core messages I do
    support, we should come to an end. Furthermore, the discussions on the
    board start to get into an exchange of arguments for sake of the
    argument (``and here is yet another reason why I'm right and you are
    wrong \ldots'':). We have to be careful here and come to a conclusion,
    in particular in case where it does not matter what we decide
    (bitvector vs. integer, the arguments are on the table so we go ahead.)
  \item The second underlying message (``If we only had taken the carefully
    and painfully worked out good specification, then we would not had
    those problems'') I do not completely support (I pointed that out on
    the board). It's true that the specs had been worked out well, but we
    are currently somehow deep in ``Varchar(29)'' (a typo) or ``BigInt''
    vs. ``Int'' and all this kind of stuff, and also inconsistency remarks.
    
    I would rather guess, that both of the two delivered specs would have
    drawn equal flak as well, once it came to the details or it came to
    realizing them really. We might have saved, I agree, a week or so, when
    just taking one of the specs and pour them into SQL (because the
    discussion would have started just one week earlier) but some discussion
    would have evolved.  
    
    The counter argument, ``perhaps the other spec's had been some open
    point, but at least \emph{we} had to implement it'' does not really
    hold, because \emph{all} have to implement it. Live would indeed be
    easier if each group could implement whatever it chooses (spec 1, or
    spec 2, or some additions/subset), but that's not the idea.
  \item Related to the above concern (``general development, apart from
    technical details'') I further agree with Sandro (if that was his point):
    No unannouced critical changes which influences someone else. This holds
    even for \emph{healthy} changes.\footnote{Unless one really trusts each
      other.} 
  \end{itemize}
\item And again related to the above: \textbf{the means of communication.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item I can't speak for the rest of the audience, but it could be that
      this BB is not the fastest means of communication, in particular for
      \emph{agreement.} This is not to propose email instead, but
      \emph{sometimes} to come together and solve trivial technical things and
      that's it. What I mean is that for some issue the net time to follow
      long discussion, and browing and quotes etc, is longer than the net time
      to sit together (or make an appointment with (me and/or Marcel and/or
      Gunnar), drop by and hammer it out. Also face-to-face sometimes makes
      compromise easier, and that's important as well.
    \item This was raised (by Gunnar) commenting on ``agreements in the
      forum''. I agree with him in this point. Technically, since we (so far)
      said in the meeting, that the forum does \emph{not} constitute an
      obligatory means of communication, there can't be \emph{obligatory}
      agreements concerning topics of general interest on the forum.
      
      A different thing would be that group \emph{X} decides that everyone
      in this groups \emph{must} read the relevant group and thus the
      people are forced to use the board. In this point, I agree with
      \emph{Gunnar}. \texttt{Scherbengestalt} mentioned: ``I don't see
      what's going on'' and ``too many communication channels''. For the
      last point, that's difficult to change. The only that one can change
      is to reduce the \emph{obligatory} channels (if someone likes to send
      someone else an SMS about the project, it's difficult to do something
      about).
    \item Here's the means of communication that we have:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{snv logs:} I do not recommend this as means of
        communication, unless we decide this, but I think it does not work,
        and we have enough others. Especially now, where somehow lot's of
        stuff seem to get checked in, probably we would be swamped by
        reading meaninless logs. As a matter of fact, many of the logs (by
        me and also by others) are plain empty.
      \item \textbf{after-the-fact Readmes:} I'd recommend that Readmes are
        short and \emph{stable.} but not used as a means of communication
        of changes. In this way, it's more used as a \textbf{log-file.}
        Especially, it can turn out contraproductive, to change someone
        else's work and not it down in the Readme (I don't know whether we
        had this already).
      \item Also, in the mediumm run a bad means (or a sign of bad)
        communication: \textbf{``hand-versioned''} files like
        \texttt{file-x} checked in. At least the alternatives \emph{must}
        as soon as possible been resolved.
        
        In some sense, it's the polite way of avoiding the previous point
        (just change someone else's stuff and the other have to swallow it
        or undo it). In the medium run, it's equally bad, because we will
        loose overview. For instance, currently we have \emph{3 versions}
        of the data-model in textual form lying around (two in the repos +
        one posted on the board accessible via some url) and 1 in SQL
        format. All versions are different. Version 2 seems to be the
        evolution of version 1, one can guess that. Apart from that,
        however,\footnote{and besides the fact that we have to come to a
          conclusion, which is important \ldots.} there creep in slight
        inconsistencies, for instance things that had been resolved in
        version 2, suddenly re-appear in version 3, which makes a proposal
        to solve one point in version 2, but \emph{reentroduces} stuff that
        had been there in version 1. 
        
        The danger therefore is, that one looses overview (and we are
        talking here about \emph{one} (important) file.  This means, it is
        (also) a problem of communication, because one forces the others to
        go through the code again, compare it, see new additions, see that
        old stuff has not been taken into account. Basically, it's the same
        situation as in the previous point, only more ``polite'' at the
        surface.
      \item \textbf{Bugzilla} has not yet proved how helpful it will be,
        but I guess it is.
      \item \textbf{email:} In my eyes, email so far is not a problem, at
        least not the \emph{official emails} via \texttt{swprakt+coma},
        basically there's one or 2 emails per week. How groups use email
        internally, we don't exactly know.
      \item\textbf{Face-to-face:} probably, in this phase, we need to use
        this more \ldots Especially, we would like to recommend also to
        make separate appointments (with each group) apart from the general
        meetings. This will cost (also us) time, but is probably effective
        in the current stage.
      \item \textbf{Web-page:} we maintain the web-page as server for
        information (keeping the handouts, specs,, the announcemetn emails
        etc) I think, that's important.
      \end{itemize}
      The remarks about the bad means are, in some sense, more
      \emph{psychological} than \emph{technical}.  one usually tend to feel
      ``neglected'' if someone changes someone without announcement, or
      adds a ``better'' version of the file, and this is aggravated by the
      tendency \emph{not to read} the Readme's etc. (``I undertand what I
      want, but what the heck has \texttt{XXX} checked in here, well, I
      don't care/I don't understand, mine was good, too, I go ahead'').
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Structure of the repos:} Also here, it starts getting out
    of hand. we see sign of bad structure, for instance \emph{names} as
    directory identifiers. It is good to have clean areas of
    responsabilities, but I tend to think it as not a good sign of
    structuring to see it reflected in the ``code''.\footnote{At the server
      side, it might be tolerable, but the ``user version'' should not have
      to deal with packages called ``Alice'' and ``Bob''.} It could again
    be some polite way of avoiding communication and current conflicts
    (``Let me do my stuff in ``Alice'' and so I leave you in peace in your
    directory in ``Bob'', I don't even look). If it works like this, it's
    ideal, but probably, the situation is not as clean.
    
    Related to the above problems that we see with some of the means of
    communication, we must insist of \textbf{keeping the repos clean!} 
    By this I mean
    \begin{itemize}
    \item no \textbf{garbage}/no \textbf{duplicates}/no \textbf{stale
        code}: it must for the people affected, be clear at (almost) each
      point, what is there, what is the the current version that is
      relevant etc.  Of course, it's impossible (and we should not even
      try) that everyone knows everything what's there all the time.  But:
      if something affects others, those concerned must be ``warned'' in
      advance before something is added/changed etc. This warning need not
      be an email or long thread, it can mean \emph{sitting together}
    \item clear separation of own source and third-party stuff (if we have
      some such).
    \item
