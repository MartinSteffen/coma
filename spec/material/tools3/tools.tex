\section*{Summary of the tools for CoMa}


\section{What is CoMa?}
CoMa is a Conferencing Manager, which should be implemented as a \\ 
Server/Client Architecture using HTML.\\
In this context the following tools are our choice.\\
\section{The Web Server - Apache}
http://www.apache.org
\begin{quote}
  Pro's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item it costs nothing
	\item easy to install
	\item it's fast
	\item it's easy to configure
	\item robust
	\item embedded PHP-Module
  \end{itemize}
  Contra's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item costs plenty of ressources
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\section{The Database Management System - MySQL}
http://mysql.com
\begin{quote}
  Pro's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item it costs nothing
	\item easy to install
	\item it's fast
	\item easy to configure
	\item all base SQL elements are supported
	\item lots of functionalities (like timecount and complete view on datastrukture)
  \end{itemize}
  Contra's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item doesn't match all SQL-standards, no one does :P
	\item limited support of transactions  
	\item supports no ''Union''-Queries (subselect)
	\item supports no ''views''
	\item supports no ''stored procedures''
	\item supports no ''trigger''
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}


\section{The Programming-Language - PHP}
http://www.php.net\\
The URL also includes a good overview of all existing php-functions and tutorials.
\begin{quote}
  Pro's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item easy to learn (close to c syntax)
	\item costs nothing
	\item ditributed freely an easy to install
	\item special design for WWW-oriented codings
	\item automated typing (weak typed)
	\item size of arrays can be dynamically altered at runtime
	\item easy to use Database-Interface
	\item less code generating much Output (Output-oriented)
	\item optional possibility of object oriented coding Style
	\item build-in web-functions (Sessions, Cookies, Headers)
	\item \emph{Write-And-Run-Programming} (no compiling, no reboot of server, etc.)
	\item platformindependent, code is copied in plain text
  \end{itemize}
  Contra's:
  \begin{itemize}
	\item existing ceiling of Access-Capacity
	\item security risks:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Code is ''plain text''
	  \item weak typing
	  \item automated Embedding of GET- and POST-Parametres 
	  \item vulnerable to denial of service attack
	\end{enumerate}
	\item relatively high amount of runtime at complex module architecture
	\item relatively complicated module architecture at complex modules
	\item due to weak typing no error messages on wrong use of variables etc
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}


\section{Enhancing Software - PHPMyAdmin}
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/
\begin{quote}
  Pro's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item costs nothing
	\item easy to install
	\item guarantees full access on the mysql database via webinterface
	\item clearly laid out
	\item intuitive usage (Data oriented)
  \end{itemize}
  Contra's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item requires PHP
	\item requires MySQL (PostGres or MSSQL avariants available)
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}


\section{SVN}
http://subversion.tigris.org/
\begin{quote}

    \item costs nothing
	\item easy to install
	\item plug-ins for several Programming APIs available
	\item plug-in for windows explorer available (TortoiseSVN)
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}


\section{Editoren}
\begin{quote}
  Pro's:
  \begin{quote}
    Due to the choice of PHP and SVN there is no need of a special Programming-API,
	for the Code of PHP is understood by all Editors, which understand plain text.
	So every programmer is able to use his/her favorite API (e.g. Eclipse, Emacs, VI, Notepad, ...)
  \end{quote}
  Contra's:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item no guarantee for uniform coding (Line-Feeds, Tabs, etc)
	\item perhaps editor built-in additions in the sourcecode
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}
