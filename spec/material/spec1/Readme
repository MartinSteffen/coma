This is material, handed in by the Spec-1 group

(the slides of their presentation + the data model).

Steffen: I cleaned it up a bit, i.e., kept only the source-files (ppt + tex
+ the graphic for the ps). I checked in also the ``Siegel'' to make it
compilable for all.

Waller: The new Material is optimized for pdf-Output only...
  This should be our complete Specification (~20 pages)

removed datenmodell.tex (it's just an old Version of spezifiaktion.tex)

spezifikation.texx should compile without problems with pdflatex
