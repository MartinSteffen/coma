\begin{abstract}
  This document (at the current stage) descibes the data that are to be
  represented in the Tool.  \ifweb It is available also as
  \href{main.pdf}{pdf}.  \else It is also available via the website. \fi It
  is not the full specification, in particular, no dynamic behavior is yet
  represented or described (except by some hints)
  
  It serves to \emph{consolidate} at least this core part and allow to push
  ahead, in particular the SQL-group.  It is considered
  \emph{consolidated}, in that is is final up-to necessary changes.  To
  reflect the development, the specification is qualified with a versioning
  number.
  
  The document does not yet mention yet all the restrictions, the dynamic
  apsects, or the scenarios and phases and further information that has
  been found in the specifications generated in the first phase.
