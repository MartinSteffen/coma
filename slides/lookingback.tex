\section{Evaluation}



\frame{\frametitle{What's good?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> it's \importantx{over}!
    \only<3->{
    \item we have running tools ready-oid and shipped
    \item not a single \important{drop-out} during semester (that was a
      \important{serious!} problem in previous F-Praktika)
    \item the \important{task} as such was ok 
    \item \important{snert} (despite it's age and performance limitations) did
      quite \important{ok}, little down-time, \important{no data loss}
    \item quite some heterogenous environment/tool sets $\Rightarrow$ lots of
      (well, practical) stuff to cope with, to find ones way }
  \end{itemize}}

\frame{\frametitle{Neutral/beyond our control}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item many participants
  \item some communication \important{overhead}: \important{Yes!} that beyond
    our control.  Even with \important{1 person} there's communication
    overhead\footnote{if the task is big enough/long enough, the programmer at
      some point during of the task has to communicate with the programmer
      later state (himself, only older), for instance via documentation.}
  \item little \important{theory} (some people like that, some don't)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[-] in addition to (fail to) \important{work together} and
      \important{get organized} etc, we did not learn \important{anything
        theoretical}
    \item[+] more effort into other stuff.
    \end{itemize}
  \item lot's of tiny little problems: well, that how it is \ldots
  \end{itemize}
}
\frame{\frametitle{Things we did not like}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \importantx{passivity} 
  \item some internal \importantx{in-fighting} within some groups
  \item ``\important{death march}'' or at least monstrous hectic at the end
    (year after it's the same)\footnote{Actually, it seems almost to be
      a universal constant for all human endeavor \ldots}
  \item \importantxx{laaaate} integration/testing on the target platform (year
    after year, it's the same)\footnote{In this year, it was in some of the
      groups in particular postpone \importantxx{till the veeerry end} to try
      out \emph{snert} even if it was said from the beginning: there is
      exactly/only \important{one platform} which counts, namely snert. Note
      that even if we pretended that we intend to do it platform-independent,
      announcing a predefined machine in advance is of course the opposite of
      platform-independence.}
  \item we did not manage to have a \important{common spec}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the common \important{data model} costed to much sweat/time/friction
      already, the course was on the brink of breaking!
    \item we (as org) did not had the \important{time} to hunt after that
      issue as we tried for the data-model spec.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Other remarks, heard}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the task is \importantxx{too small} for so many
    people?\footnote{remarked by more than one participant. E.g. in the form
      ``If I were alone, I could \ldots''}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item well, could indeed be\ldots \only<2->{\importantx{But think again!}
        This implies either
        \begin{itemize}
        \item only projects with \important{less people} are possible, or
        \item \importantx{adding} more requirements/tasks/feature would have
          made it \importantx{simpler!}
        \end{itemize}}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \importantxx{too many comm. channels}\ actually, we don't exactly know
    what to leave out
    \begin{itemize}
    \item indispensable: \important{svn}, also
      \important{bugzilla}\footnote{Some did not like bugzilla, but I think it was
        more important to have some bug tracking}
    \item \important{bulletin board:} you will have noticed: the BB went much
      out of use lately, when the hacking effort became harder!
    \end{itemize}
  \item \important{global meetings}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item perhaps one should make meetings smaller, 
    \item sometimes they seem to be a \important{waste of time} for most
      participants, but no: \importantxx{I'm not talking about the data-base
        discussions!} 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{What about the org group?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \importantxx{be harder/stricter} (deadlines, requirements, whatever) ??
  \item \importantxx{specify} exactly what you want, and we do it
    \begin{itemize}
    \item can be advantageous. On the other hand: the challenge here was:  we
    (the org) are the \emph{clients} we know (a bit) what we want, you have to
    find a solution
    \end{itemize}
  \item \importantxx{monitor} exactly what's going on, repair \ldots
    \begin{itemize}
    \item not really possible with $> 20$ participants
    \end{itemize}
  \item \important{repeat} the \textsl{Praktikum}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[+] less effort for us, more time for monitoring etc
    \item[+] better feeling for the hard parts, better assistance in
      ``load-balance'' etc.
    \item[-] less ``realistic'', later your boss/manager\ldots will not
      exactly know what you are doing, there won't be ``Musterl\"osungen'' in
      your later life.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Things to do/org better}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item not two spec groups?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item avoids bickering/merging/friction/disappointment which spec to take
    \item[-] we cannot have all the rest as tools-groups, because the tools
      groups where wasted time
    \end{itemize}
  \item \important{testing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the integration/set-up for the testing \important{must} be organized
      differently, this year the set-up did not work out
    \end{itemize}
  \item \important{tools/platform choice}: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item largely a \important{waste of time}, \important{just do
        it}/\important{document it} and that's it\footnote{In realistic
        situations, the choice of weapons and platforms is of course not a
        waste of time.  In our case, I'd say it was.}
    \end{itemize}
  \item some small stuff: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item we \important{lost} some weeks:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item for instance after the first demo,
      \item because of protracted SQL-discussion
      \item after X-mas, delay in the status/plan 
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item hard \importantxx{deadline/milestone} around X-mas
  \end{itemize}

        The result/the process is not ``\important{professional}'', why is

          After all, rather soon \important{you are professional} computer

\only<2>{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item well, we listed some points which we think did not work/haven't been
    organized too well
  \item almost everyone was mainly busy with \important{his module}, little
    serious effort outside one's own home ground field.\footnote{we don't know
      directly, it's an impression: especially the PHP1 group, they kept
      problems ---if they had any--- under the carpet.}
  \item \important{symptom}: in the general meetings: desinterest or even
    \important{``bad vibes''} if ``\importantx{forced}'' to discuss things
    beyound one owns interest\footnote{Indeed, the SQL-discussion started to
      go bitter, for somehow unwillingness to take the effort. The general
      feeling was: ``C'mon, it's a waste of time, to agree on this/to discuss
      this, leave us alone.''}
  \item[$\Rightarrow$] \importantx{much more} effort into ``boring'' stuff]
    e.g., 2 persons (or more) in a group doing nothing else than
    \important{integrating,} checking whether all \important{fits together,}
    having an \important{technical overview} over the \important{interplay},
    perhaps group ``sub-leader''
    \begin{itemize}
    \item difficult in a course: ``what's my contribution?'', ``do I pass the
      exam without a line of code written?'', who is the subleader

    \important{testing}/documenting/making it usable?

    \end{itemize}
  \item \important{laaaate} first code delivery (26.\ June) /compilation,
    \important{laaate} integration (with all the consequences)
  \item we always had quite some breaches of \important{interfaces}, but:
    this year was the first time, I had to \important{discuss} why this is

  \item stricter, enforced cvs-strategy?: \important{enforced
    compilability} for checking-in?
\item user \important{logging} (currently, I don't know how, the official
  university's server can do it, but there are other disadvantages of that
  solution)?
  \item stricter surveillance (e.g.\ for absynt), \important{watches}
  \item no \important{separation} between gui and editor? But an explicit
    \important{test} group.
  \item other means of communication? (\emph{news-group?}, cvs-logs?)
