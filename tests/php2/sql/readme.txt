These scripts are autogenerated by the shell scripts in the "util" directory.
You can try to change it but it is not recommended. To generate the scripts for a specific database that not "comadb", run the all.sh script passing the database name as argument. You MUST run it from the util directory!

Example for database "mydb"

cd ../util/
./all.sh mydb
