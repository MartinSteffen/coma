M. Steffen and M. Kyas where absent, the session was chaired by
G. Schaefer..

Author: M. Steffen

The discussion was not noted down in written form, so I produce the minutes
from the Discussion with Gunnar.


======

Topic: tool have been presented, it seems that
       the group is split into 2 equally large
       groups:

       - lightweight:  php/apache etc

       - heavyweight: Java, EJB, servlet /tomcat/jboss

This probably means, that there will be two separate groups.
