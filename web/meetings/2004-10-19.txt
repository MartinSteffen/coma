The first meeting.

present: almost everyone listed in the original members list (some
came a day later or so)

+ M. Steffen, M. Kyas.


---------------------

Results: not much, it was just the kick-off.


  > group division into 3 kinds of task-forces
   
      - spec
      - tools
      - testing

   which must work-out either a more precise specification, a
   choice of languages and tools, or a test concept.

   Each group is urged to consult us


   > informal talk by the organizers about the general task

   > short intro of everyone, to get an impression of what the people know

     java:             most everyone
     script-languages: many
     data-bases:       some
     cvs:              many
