1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  Installation of CoMa requires the following:

    * A webserver or web hosting account running on any major Operating System
          o Tested on Apache 2.0.51
    * A MySQL database system that supports InnoDB (3.23 or higher)
          o Tested on MySQL 3.23.58
    * PHP (4.3 and above) with support for MySQL
          o Tested on PHP 4.3.10
          o see Troubleshooting for required Settings in php.ini
    * A modern Webbrowser (best capable with CSS)
          o Tested with IE6, Opera7, Firefox1



2. INSTALLATION

  If you have basic knowledge of using FTP and are sure your hosting service
  or server will run CoMa you can use these steps to quickly get started.
  For a more detailed explanation you should skip this and go to the section
  below.

   1. Decompress the CoMa archive to a local directory on your system.
        o coma1.tar.gz - Linux / Unix version (CR)
        o coma1.zip    - Windows Version (CR/LF)
   2. Upload all the files contained in this archive (retaining the directory
      structure, but see below) to a web accessible directory on your server or
      hosting account.
   3. Using your web browser visit the location you placed CoMa with the
      addition of coma1/INSTALL.PHP, e.g.
      http://www.mydomain.com/coma1/INSTALL.PHP,
      http://www.mydomain.com/~username/coma1/INSTALL.PHP etc.
   4. Follow the steps 1.-3.
   5. CoMa should now be available.

  Hint: You can even rename the directory 'coma1' or remove it completely,
    retaining its content of course! Proceed accordingly for the rest of the
    Installation with a changed path.
    e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/INSTALL.PHP

3. DETAILED INSTALLATION

  Installation of CoMa will vary according to your server and database. If
  you have shell access to your account (via telnet or ssh for example)
  you may want to upload the entire CoMa archive (in binary mode!) to a
  directory on your host and unarchive it there.

  If you do not have shell access or do not wish to use it you will need to
  decompress the CoMa archive to a local directory on your system using your
  favourite compression program, e.g. winzip, rar, zip, tar, etc. From there
  you must FTP upload ALL the files it contains (being sure to retain the
  directory structure and filenames) to your host. Please ensure that the cases
  of filenames are retained, do NOT force filenames to all lower or upper case
  doing so will cause errors later.

  Equally if you do not have FTP access or do not wish to use it, you will need
  to have shell access. If you are unsure how to do so, please read your ssh
  manual.

  All .php and .tpl files should be uploaded in ASCII mode, while all graphics
  should be uploaded in BINARY mode. If you are unfamiliar with what this means
  please refer to your FTP client documentation. In most cases this is all
  handled automatically by your ftp client but if you encounter problems later
  you should be sure the files where uploaded correctly as described here.

  Once all the files have been uploaded to your site you should point your
  browser at this location with the addition of coma1/INSTALL.PHP (please note
  that if you changed the extension from php, see Section 1. below, you should
  alter INSTALL.PHP appropriately). For example if your domain name is
  www.mydomain.tld and you placed CoMa in a directory /coma1 off your web root
  you would enter http://www.mydomain.tld/coma1/INSTALL.PHP into your browser.
  When you have done this you should see the Coma Installation screen appear.

  1. Changing the file extension
     If the file extension used to execute PHP scripts on your server is NOT
     .php but for example .php3 or .phtml you should first rename ALL files
     ending in .php and change all occurances of .php in all files. In the vast
     majority of cases this step will be unncessary.

  2. Installing on MySQL 3 and 4
     Before proceeding with installation you should ensure you have a database
     available. Most good hosting accounts now come with at least one database
     as part of the basic package although it may need to be setup before first
     use. Ask your provider for details if you are unsure whether you do or not.
     If you are running your own server and are unsure how to create a database
     you should refer to your SQL servers documentation or website, e.g.
     http://www.mysql.com/doc/, etc.

  3. The INSTALL.PHP

  3.1 Creating the Cofiguration File
      In this step you should enter your MySQL Sever details (see above).
      If you do not have or do not know the database name, database server, etc.
      please check with your hosting provider. The database server is typically
      localhost but this is NOT universal!

      After generating the config.inc.php INSTALL.PHP will then attempt to write
      to the config.inc.php file which will contain the basic configuration data
      used to run CoMa. If the installer cannot write config.inc.php directly
      you will be given the option of either downloading the file or manually
      copying its content. If you choose to download you should then re-upload
      the file to your server, overwriting the existing config.inc.php in the
      process. In either case the original Version is located in the /include/
      subdirectory. eg /coma1/include/config.inc.php

  3.2 Creating the Database
      There is not that much to do in this step.
      If anything fails, please doublecheck Step 3.1!

  3.3 Creating Tutorial Data (optional)
      Select Step 'Tutorial' to create a Tutorial Conference, which will help
      getting started.
      If you do so: you may begin with User: sae@me.de Password: pw
      (btw. in the Tutorial, all generated Users have Password: pw)

  3.4 Deleting INSTALL.PHP
      Due to security risks it is absolutely neccessary to remove the file
      INSTALL.PHP. The installer tries to do so, but if it fails, you have to
      do so manually, e.g using your ftp tool.
      Please note that until this file is removed CoMa will not operate and
      a warning message will be displayed.

  4. Enjoy CoMa - Your Conference Manager
     You may now Register a new User. Later (using this User) you can create and
     manage multiple Conferences. See Help for mor Infos.



4. TROUBLESHOOTING

  1. Paper upload does not work:

     Please ensure that the following PHP Configuration Settings are done:
       file_uploads "1"
       upload_tmp_dir "any directory PHP has write access to"
       upload_max_filesize "2M" (or even more)
       post_max_size "greater than upload_max_filesize"
       memory_limit "greater than post_max_size"

  2. Required Setting in php.ini
       get_magic_quotes_gpc "0"
       session.auto_start "0"
