     basically any normal Webserver should do the job.

  2. PHP 4.3.0+
     It is required to use at least PHP version 4.3.0+. It was developed under
     4.3.10, so anything above that should fit the requirements :)

     CoMa uses InnoDB Tables, so you should use any MySQL Version capable to
     do so.
