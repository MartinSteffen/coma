The main item on the login page is the login form. It has two text fields: the first, labelled 'email address', is where you type in the email address with which you registered, the second, named 'password' is where you type in the password for your account. If you don't have an account you can register for one using the first link below the login form. For help with registering see the related link 'registering for an account'. The last link on the registration page is the 'get a new password' link. If you forgot your password, CoMa will generate a new password and send it to the email address you supplied.
