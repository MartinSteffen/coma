  It is recommended to proceed as following:<br>
  Let CoMa make a <a href="{basepath}.php{?SID}" class="link">suggestion</a> of
  a possible paper/reviewer distribution for papers that are not assigned to the
  average number of reviewers wanted yet.<br>
  You may edit the suggested distribution and confirm it then.<br>
  After that, you can assign several papers by hand (this formular) or re-start
  the suggestion process.
