This window contains a form for typing in the information CoMa needs to manage your conference. Fields marked with an asterisk <span class="alert">*</span> have to be filled out. First, title your conference. Then you can give an optional description and a homepage of the conference (for example: http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de). Then some dates have to be filled out: When your conference starts, when it ends (optional), four deadlines and the date for notification %%date for notification? Wer wird ueber was benachrichtigt an diesem Datum?%%. There are some more settings which are set to (usually sensible) default values. These settigs are not shown on this page so as not to make things too complicated for you. If you want to view or modify the additional settings, click the button 'advanced settings'. If you are finished with the form, click the 'create conference' button.
