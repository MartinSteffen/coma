Well, you found the help page for the help page! The help page is accessible via the 'help' link in the menu, and via the little 'i' (for information) in the upper right corner of evry window in CoMa. If the help page is called by the 'i' link, only the help chapter for the page you were viewing at that time is displayed. If the help page is called from the menu, the table of contents is displayed and you can read through every chapter.
