The reviewer's main overview shows you the tasks you can choose from. Your main task, reviewing the papers assigned to you, is accessible via the 'manage my reviews' link found in the text or in the menu to the left. You can also take part in the discussions of the papers assigned to you, simply click 'reviewing discussions' in the text or click the 'Paper Forums' link in the menu. The 'manage my preferences' link, called 'edit my preferences' in the menu, brings you to a page where you can specify which topics or papers you prefer or deny.
