The chair's main overview page shows the possible actions you can do as chair, including short descriptions about those actions. You can select what you want to do from the chair's menu or directly from the links in the overview page. Additionally, if one or more tasks in a certain field of duty await your decisions, a red-colored note will appear informing you of the nature of the task.
