This page shows you the conferences managed by CoMa. In the table you can see a short overview over the conferences including some detail information, such as the conference title, the start and the end date, and a link to the website of the conference. Note that this might be an external link. Additionally, you will have some options regarding the conferences: You can apply as chair, reviewer or author, or you can sign up as participant for a conference. Simply click the corresponding buttons below the conference information. If you have already applied for one of those positions, you will instead see a button labelled 'Login'. Click this button to login to that conference. There is only one login button for each conference because CoMa remembers all your roles in a conference. If you instead want CoMa to manage your own conference, click on the link at the lower end of the page called 'create a new conference'.
