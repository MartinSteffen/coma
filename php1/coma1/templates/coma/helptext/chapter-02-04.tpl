The profile page contains the same information you could supply during registration. You may add, edit or delete information as you please, but you always have to supply a valid email address and your last name. If you want to change your email or password, for security reasons you have to supply your current password also. If you want to change your password, type your new password in the fields labelled "password" and "repeat password". You have to type your new password twice to prevent typing errors. When you are finished, click the 'accept changes' button. Click the 'reset settings' button to reset the form to the defaults.
