The advanced settings let you define some minimum and maximum values for your conference: You can enter the minimum and the maximum number of papers you wnat to choose for the conference, the minimum number of reviewers and the default number of reviewers. These values are used by the distribution algorithm, see the related links. You can also set a critical ambiguity value (in percent). This value tells CoMa when to notify you if the ratings of the reviewers for a paper are too different. Next, there are some checkboxes. The first, 'accept author accounts automatically', tells CoMa not to bother you when someone wants to sign up as author. CoMa will simply accept the authors signup request. If the box is unchecked, you will be notified of the request and you will manually have to accept or decline it. The 'add reviewers to critical papers automatically' checkbox tells CoMa that if a paper rating is critical (see above), additional reviewers will be added to the paper to get more opinions. If the box is unchecked, you will have to do this manually (see the related links). You can specify the number of reviewers CoMa will add automatically (this value will have no effect if the 'add reviewers to critical papers automatically' box is not checked). When you are finished adding and modifying the advanced settings, click 'submit changes' to create your conference, or click 'simple settings' to go back to the simple settings page. You also have the option to delete the conference. Note that clicking the 'delete conference' button will have no effect if the checkbox left of the button is not checked.
