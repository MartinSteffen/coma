This page allows you to tell CoMa your attitudes towards certain topics and papers. You will get a list of topics this conference is about, in which you can state if you absolutely don't want to get papers about that topic ('exclude'), if you would prefer not to get papers about it ('deny'), if you would like papers concerning it ('prefer') or if you don't care ('no attitude'). The same applies to the papers list below the topics list; here you can choose the same settings for specific papers. Click 'accept changes' to submit your settings to CoMa. 'Reset settings' will reset the values. Note that if you are the author of a paper, you can not set your preferences towards that paper; you will be automatically excluded from the list of possible reviewers for that paper.
Click the title of a paper in the list to get detailed information about that paper. Clicking the name of an author will instead show you more information about the papers author.
