This page is another paper overview, showing which reviewers are assigned to which paper. The table shows title, author, status, number of reviews, rating, ambiguity%%auf der Seite steht noch varianz%% and which reviewers are assigned to a specific paper. You can access more information about the assigned reviewers and the author of a paper by clicking their names. Beneath the title of the paper, a link 'view review report' leads to the details of the individual review ratings. Another link, either 'start discussion' or 'enter discussion', will do the following: 'start discussion' will create a new paper forum for the reviewers to discuss it. 'enter discussion' leads you to the paper discussion forum if it already exists. Under the status displayed for the paper, the links 'accept', 'reject' or 'reset status' might appear. They allow you to reset the status, or immediately accept or reject a paper. Another link, 'edit reviewers', beneath the 'assigned reviewers', links to a page where you can alter the list of reviewers for the paper.
Above the paper list, CoMa offers to make a suggestion for you on how to distribute the reviewers among the papers. CoMA will try to pay respect to the wishes of the chairs and the reviewers, and will make sure an author cannot review his own paper. Click on 'suggestion' to let CoMa do the work for you!
