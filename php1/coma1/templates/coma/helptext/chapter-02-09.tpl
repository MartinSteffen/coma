This page shows you a list of all CoMa users who have registered for your conference. The information includes their name, email and roles. You can let CoMa order the list by name (default) or by email by clicking the column headers. Clicking the name will bring you to another page showing you detailed information about that person. Clicking the email address will open your system's default mailer for you to email the user. In the roles column, you will see the user's roles listed. Having the role written in black means the user has that role in your conference. In this case a 'remove' link will also be shown. Click this link to remove the corresponding role from that person. On the contrary, a role will be written in light grey if the person does not have that role. An 'add' link will be shown, allowing you to grant person the role. The rightmost link in the table is only shown if the person is a reviewer. In that case, the 'view preferences' link will bring you to a page showing the reviewers paper preferences.
Note that to prevent accidents you can not remove chair status from yourself.
