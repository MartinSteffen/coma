The error page only appears when the CoMa software encountered an error during execution of one of its scripts. This should not happen and is probably a configuration error on behalf of the site host. If you got the error page, please contact the system administration (if you don't know who the system administration is or how to contact them, contact the conference's chairs, they should know) and tell them preferably as detailed as possible, what happened, what you did in beforehand, and the error message you are currently viewing in the main window.
