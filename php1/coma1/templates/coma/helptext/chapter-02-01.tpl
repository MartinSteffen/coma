The CoMa page is devided into the following sections: The title bar at the top of the browser window, the menu bar to the left of the window, the copyright bar at the bottom of the window, and the content in the middle.
The title bar consists of the CoMa logo at the left end of the bar. You can return to the CoMa start page anytime by clicking the logo. Next is the navigation bar. CoMa can be a lot of pages, and sometimes you could loose your orientation. The navigation bar always tells you which page in CoMa you are viewing. The navigation bar also has a little information printed to the right end about the CoMa version you are using. Additionally, if you are logged in, your username is displayed in the navigation bar. Above the navigation bar, to the right end of the title bar, the 'logout' and 'information' links are located. Clicking the 'logout' link will log you out of CoMa. Click the information link anytime to get detailed information on which page you are currently viewing and what that page is good for.
The menu bar displays links to all the tasks you have access to in your current role in this conference. Some menu items are always there: the profile link (modify your profile), the conference link (view information about the conference), the forums (discuss conference-related topics with other participants), the help link (the complete CoMa help pages), and the select conference link (clicking this will log you out of the current conference and redirect you to the conferences overview page for you to choose a new conference to log into).
The copyright bar shows the developers of the CoMa software, and the render time (the time how long it took the server to build the page). Note the little triangle link called 'top'. On any page in CoMa, clicking that link will bring you back to the top of the page.
The content of the page depends on which page you have called.
