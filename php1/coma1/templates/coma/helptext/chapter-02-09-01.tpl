This list shows you the papers submitted for your conference and the settings the specific reviewer chose for them. If the reviewer is the author of the paper, the word 'exclude' will be written in red. If the reviewer does not want to review the paper, the word 'deny' will appear in dark red. If the reviewer specifically wants to review the paper or his preferred topics match the topics of the paper the word 'prefer' will appear in green (see the related links for more information about the importance of topics in your conference). If nothing of the above applies, 'no attitude' will appear black.
Clicking the title of a paper in the table will bring you to a page with detailed information about that paper. Clicking the name of the author will get you to a page with more information about the author.
When you are finished on the view preferences page, you can click the 'last page' link to return to the page you previously viewed.
