The advanced settings let you define some minimum and maximum values for your conference: You can enter the minimum and the maximum number of papers you wnat to choose for the conference, the minimum number of reviewers and the default number of reviewers. These values are used by the distribution algorithm, see the related links. You can also set a critical ambiguity value (in percent). This value tells CoMa when to notify you if the ratings of the reviewers for a paper are too different. Next, there are some checkboxes. The first, 'accept author accounts automatically', tells CoMa not to bother you when someone wants to sign up as author. CoMa will simply accept the authors signup request. If the box is unchecked, you will be notified of the request and you will manually have to accept or decline it. 'Start discussion of critical papers automatically' tells CoMa that in case of the reviews of a paper being too different from each other a forum will be created automatically in which the reviewers can discuss the paper and maybe change their review ratings. If the box is not checked, you will be notified if the reviews of a paper are critical and CoMa will ask you if you want the aforementioned discussion forum to be created. The 'add reviewers to critical papers automatically' checkbox tells CoMa that if a paper rating is critical (see above), additional reviewers will be added to the paper to get more opinions. If the box is unchecked, you will have to do this manually (see the related links). You can specify the number of reviewers CoMa will add automatically (this value will have no effect if the 'add reviewers to critical papers automatically' box is not checked). With the text field 'topics' you can add topics to your conference. This is important for the authors, since they will have to choose from the topics you provided here which match with the topics of their papers, and for the reviewers who can say which topics they prefer. Last are the criterions after which the reviewers rate the papers. Simply type in the name of the criterion, a short description in the text area below, the maximum value a reviewer can assign to that criterion (the spectrum ranges from 0 to the maximum value), and how important this value is for you, measured by the weight. The weights of all criterions must add up to 1.
When you are finished adding and modifying the advanced settings, click 'create conference' to create your conference, or click 'simple settings' to go back to the simple settings page.
