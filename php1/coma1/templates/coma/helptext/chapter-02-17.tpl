As an author you are able to submit abstracts until the 'Deadline for
abstracts' and
until the 'Deadline for paper submission' you are able to submit papers.
The 'Current status' tells you if your paper is reviewed, accepted or
rejected.
The 'Average rating' shows you the rating until this time in percent. Maybe
there are serveral reviewers for your paper.
Note that until the 'Deadline for reviews' the average rating could change.
However, if you have a good or bad rating this time, the chairs of the
conference have the possibility to accept or reject your paper at any time.
