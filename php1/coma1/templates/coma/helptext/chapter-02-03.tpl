The only item on this page is the registration form. The fields of the form are self-explanatory, fields marked with an asterisk <span class="alert">*</span> are required for registration. Leaving them blank will result in a warning message asking you to fill them out. You don't have to fill out the fields without an asterisk. To prevent typing errors on your password, there are two password fields. Simply re-type what you typed in the first password field. When you are finished, click the button labelled 'register'. If you filled out all the necessary fields your registration will be confirmed and you will be able to login.
