\begin{abstract}
  This handout serve to prepare the decision finding, in particular
  concering the ``group-architecture'' for the rest of the semester. We
  propose a certain group-structure as base for discussion, and give
  arguments and motivations about that structure. Consider the structure
  and think whether it makes sense from your perspective. If not, give
  arguments/alternatives.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Where are we?}



What's needed now is to keep on rolling (or for some to get rolling
\ldots). The \emph{first phase} is \emph{finished} which gave some
clarification about the following points

\begin{itemize}
\item how many people still on board
\item what tools we choose.
\item some more insight on the specification, in particular the data model.
\end{itemize}

As a further comment on what happened so far is, that the spec-groups had
the tougher task as compared to the tools groups.


\subsection*{Status}




\begin{description}
\item[Org:] Snert is up and running (buzilla, email-exploder, svn,
  passwords handed out); some proposal for the next step is worked out
\item[tools:] we have statements about tools etc from the tools groups (in
  written form only by Alexander Derenbach). So far, the tools groups have not
\item[Spec:] we have two (or three?) specs by today
\item[test:] we probably got one proposal from the test-groups
\end{description}

As a critical review, I'd say


\begin{itemize}
\item The specification is helpful. The fact that we have two is helpful
  insofar as we could see ideas and get inspiration and discussion from
  both. As we have seen, the work that pushed the semester ahead so far was
  the spec work, so having only one spec group would have left more people
  ``idle''.
\item The success and the usefulness (in the context of the project) is
  less transparent. This has various reasons
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the task was perhaps more fuzzy
  \item it's difficult to see the success. If the thinking about the
    platform s allowed us to avoid a definite wrong choice, even then the
    success is not visible (because we never know what would have been).
  \item Another important goal in this phase was, that the people proposing
    the tools \emph{are} or (even better from a learning perspective)
    \emph{become} experts in using/installing/maintaining the tools. From
    the organizer's perspective, we don't know to which extent this has
    happened. Also this depends on how good the ``deliverable'' of
    ``Getting started with Tool xxx'' etc will be.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Local means that one needs the code of one of the local groups for the full
tool. For instance, the configuration indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:groups}
by the dotted blob consists of the local implementation of \emph{group 1}
together with the 3 global (or shared) modules.



\section*{Group architecture}


To keep the semester rolling it is important to get something productive
(and useful) to do for everyone for the weeks (in particular already the
next week). Things to be \emph{decided} now is the group architecture. In
Figure~\ref{fig:groups}, we make some proposal. The key points are

\begin{itemize}
\item 3 local modules, which work in isolation and in parallel, considering
  the general preferences, perhaps 2 ``PHP'' groups and one ``Java'' group.
  Each group consists of \emph{6} persons
\item 3 global modules, which are relevant for all particpants. Those are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item testing: \emph{3 persons}
  \item data base: 
  \item requirements/specification
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}





Before we mention concrete tasks within this proposal in a bit more detail,
we first clarify the (partially conflicting) design goals of our proposal.
\begin{description}
\item[programming in the (not too) many:] We are, according to our
  statistics, currently \emph{21 people}. All programming in the same group
  will lead to chaos, in particular it will conflict with the goal that
  (more or less) all participants will contribute in the next phase.
  Furthermore, the task at hand is too small, so in order to make this work
  and not too many complicated interfaces, there would be a few ``real
  groups'' and the rest would do the doc, the manual, etc. 
  
  We propose therefore \emph{3 parallel, local groups.} They are small
  enough that internal communication is still possible. Furthermore, the
  parallel work might inspire competition
\item[preferences] We have seen, that the course is split into ``PHP vs.\ 
  Java'' fractions. The split allows that (probably) anybody get what he
  proposes
\item[one spec.] We propose, as the course is intended as a \emph{common}
  programming project, that we do not split it cleanly into completely
  independently working groups. Three things should remain common, which are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item testing
  \item requirements/docu, and related to that, 
  \item the concrete data representation in SQL
  \end{itemize}
\item[constant progress] Having finished (more or less) the work on
  spec/tools by \emph{today,} it is not adivsable to make further
  specification week(s) concerning the data-model.
\end{description}

\end{figure}



The goals are conflicting, and the architecture is a compromise between
goals mentioned above. A critical point are (as always) the shared modules,
and in particular the data base. The reason is that everything else depends
on that. It's less critical for testing and the requirements, obviously.
Nevertheless, built on the work of the spec-group, we need to hammer out a
unified data model concretely (down to SQL-expressions) \emph{soon-ish.}
This should doable quickly, and not much discussion should be needed there.



\subsubsection*{Structure of each group}

We propose therefore the following structure and responsibilities for each
group. So currently this still some sort of ``special assignment'', since
we are not yet coding the final product.

\begin{description}
\item[DB:]
  \begin{description}
  \item[task] \emph{one person} of group 1 -- 3 does a realization of the
    (agreed/common) data model in SQL merge them into one specific
    data-model.
  \item[deadline:] 21?
  \item[deliverable:] specification + SQL-code
  \item[profile:] preferably an SQL-specialist (or someone who wants to
    learn something new \emph{very fast}\ldots)
  \end{description}
\item[data model:] that's us, the authors of the handout
  \begin{description}
  \item[task] merge the spec. delivs into one common and approved
    specification
  \item[deadline] 18.11 (that's damn soon \ldots)
  \item[deliverable:] some textual format (or graphical, let's see.) It
    should be precise enough that the SQL-person can do their work.
  \end{description}
\item[architecture:] the rest of the persons of groups 1 --3 
  \begin{description}
    \item[task:] depending on your choice of tools: work out a
      modularization of the tools into submodules
    \item[deliverable:] presentation + written description
    \item[deadline:] 23.11
  \end{description}
\item[test:] So far, haven't found a task for those. Lucky again \ldots
\end{description}
