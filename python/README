A prototype of the coma project written in python and using postgresql.

This implementation uses postgresql as its data base engine.  I chose
this database engine to make it a bit harder for the students to use
MySQL.  But I also believe that PostgreSQL is the superior
implementation.

This implementation is SELinux aware and has been build for Fedora Core 3.
Some parts of this implementation may not work for other distributions.
